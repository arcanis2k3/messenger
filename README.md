# ZMessagez

This is a cross-platform messenger application built with React Native and Expo.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to have Node.js and the Expo CLI installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/zmessagez.git
    ```
2.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

### Running the app

You can run the app on a physical device or in a simulator.

*   To run the app on a physical device, you'll need to have the Expo Go app installed.
*   To run the app in a simulator, you'll need to have Xcode (for iOS) or Android Studio (for Android) installed.

Once you have your development environment set up, you can run the app with one of the following commands:

*   `npm run ios`: Runs the app in the iOS simulator.
*   `npm run android`: Runs the app in the Android emulator.
*   `npm start`: Starts the Metro bundler, which allows you to run the app on a physical device.

## Publishing to the App Stores

To publish the app to the app stores, you'll need to create a build of the app. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
eas build
```

This will create a build of the app that you can submit to the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. For more information, see the [Expo documentation](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/).
